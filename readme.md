### rustx

* __rustx__: Inspired by `runhaskell`, this script compiles a rust file and runs it immediately.  (This can be launched from a source file via `#!/usr/bin/env rustx`, too.)
* __rustt__: This script compiles a rust file's tests and runs them.
* **_rustx**: This is a dummy Rust program...

At the moment, this git repo doesn't seem to work quite right with `rustpkg`, but I'll sort that out soon enough!
