rustx    Inspired by `runhaskell`, this script compiles a rust file
         and runs it immediately.
         (This can be launched from a source file via `#!/usr/bin/env rustx`, too.)

rustt    This script compiles a rust file's tests and runs them.

_rustx   This is a dummy Rust program which allows Cargo to install 
         it and the scripts.
